Notes:
Objective of the script: read the (latest available) stats file and output
grouped data in one of two possible formats (XML for map application or
table for direct display in the wiki).
So far: extract data and group it according to Jurisdictions
Problem(s) hitherto: Error out of bounds when trying to group using "if
counter != counter+1" approach. (tried adding additional logic, to no
avail). This results in the last jurisdiction not being considered in the
results
Next Step: Further Group the data by license type
