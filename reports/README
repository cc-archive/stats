This directory contains code that generates reports from CC's stats database.

== charts.py ==

=== Configuration ===

At the top, set:
* BASEDIR: The directory where you want stats to be generated
* DB: A URL-style description of the path to the database you want
** (I use mysql, but SQLAlchemy will probably work with other things, e.g. sqlite or postgres.)

=== Usage ===

 $ ./charts.py <some date in ISO format, e.g. 2006-01-31>

This creates BASEDIR/<date>/ and in that directory creates a report for
each jurisdiction.
